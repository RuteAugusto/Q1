# Space Adventure
At some point in history, mankind decided that Earth wasn't enough, so they went to space and colonized several new planets.<br>
In this effort some voyages were a great success and others, a terribly failure...<br>
Space Adventure is about one of those voyages that went terribly wrong.<br>
Because of poorly calculated route, the mothership entered an asteroid ring and crashed!<br>
As a last minute resort, the commander of the ship ordered every one to make use of their space suits in order to maximize
their chances of survival in outter space.<br>
A few small space ships managed to escape from the final blast of the mothership.<br>
In this game, you are now the pilot of one of those ships, where your misson is to rescue as many astronauts as you can!<br>
Are you ready for the task?<br>

Using arrow keys you are able to avoid asteroids and rescue astronauts.
